Dear students,

As previously posted, if you have not received an invitation from us to a technical demonstration, then you have not been selected for that activity. Thus, for you, the course formally ends!

It has been a great pleasure to have you all in this course. We do hope that you have enjoyed it, despite the inevitable frustrations incurred by the very nature of the hacking process as well as by the occasional technical failures on our part in keeping the cyber range fully operational. 

For those of you who didn't complete the course this time, we know that there are many reasons for not being able to prioritize the course sufficiently. We hope that you will try again next year. 

Also, if you liked this course, then you will surely enjoy doing a master or bachelor thesis project on ethical hacking. Perhaps you'd like to hack a pace maker, the electric power grid or a car? If so, don't hesitate to contact us.

...and don't forget to fill out the course survey. It very much helps us to improve the course for future generations of students.

For those of you selected for a technical demonstration, we do look forward to meeting you. It may be comforting to know that very few people fail these technical demonstrations.

Thanks a lot,

    Pontus
