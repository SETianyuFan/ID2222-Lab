Hello chapter members!

The year is coming to an end and it is therefore time for ValSM (SM#4 the Election Chapter Meeting), the year's most important chapter meeting where all the different positions within the chapter are elected for next year.

You can nominate someone or candidate yourself for the various positions within the chapter through this form: https://sektionen.in/ValSM. (All positions are found in the form and agenda) We encourage all our members to attend the meeting and make their voices heard!

The chapter meeting takes place in Sal A starting on the 28th of November at 18:00. The bar in Kistan 2.0 will be open between 17:30-18:00 for those who want to buy soda or similar for the meeting. Food will also be served to every chapter member who comes to the meeting and registers in the form before 12:00 on the same day (November 28) https://forms.gle/z1GRnjgSdyVBgrcVA.

ID and membership will be checked at the door!
