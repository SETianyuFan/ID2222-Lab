Hello again,

A clarification to the previous email that since ValSM is such a big meeting, it lasts for two days. That means that it starts on Monday, November 28 at 18:00 as previously mentioned, but then it will also continue on Tuesday, November 29 at 18:00. Both days the meeting will be held in Sal A.

Kistan 2.0 will be open both days from 17:30-18:00 and food will be served both days to every chapter member who attends the meeting and registers in the form by 12:00 on November 28th: https://forms.gle/z1GRnjgSdyVBgrcVA.
