Welcome to IK2206 Internet Security and Privacy!

The lectures are scheduled to be given on campus, and the first lecture is tomorrow Monday Oct 31 at 13. That is the introduction lecture, which is delivered by me.

However, I have caught a cold unfortunately. I still plan to give the lecture, but it will have to be in Zoom only.

The zoom link is posted in Canvas, and I give it here as well: https://kth-se.zoom.us/j/65610722240

I will not be able to update the TimeEdit schedule with such short notice, so the official schedule still says "Ka-Sal C", which is incorrect. The lecture is in Zoom only. 

See you tomorrow at 13!
